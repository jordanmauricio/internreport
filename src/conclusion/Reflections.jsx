                <p>TRIMM turned out to be a better internship place than I could have imagined. As I’ve told my team several times before, I haven’t had the opportunity before to learn as much as I did in just 5 months. In the past 5 months, I didn’t simply add new tools and libraries to my repertoire, but I’ve improved the very way I write my programs and how I think when writing. This is far more than I had expected to leave with. </p>
                <p>During my time at TRIMM, I had come to learn about all the bits and pieces that I did not yet know about web development. Things I wouldn’t have otherwise found out, such as how to properly work with Git, how deployment happens through Docker and Jelastic, that I don’t understand certain concepts as well as I thought I did etc. With these flaws and gaps in my understanding now laid bare, I can slowly work my way through them and correct them as necessary.</p>

                <h3>Competencies</h3>
                <p>In response to the goals and competencies that I have outlined on my PLP report before beginning my internship, I believe that I’ve achieved just about all of them. First and foremost, I have built several different applications throughout my time here as is evident in this report, all of which through various levels of supervision, and all of which through a different way of “thinking” so to say. Furthermore, I tried my best to do more listening than talking, and observed how different types of people take different type of leadership positions. Marc Woesthuis, Peter and Arnoud are all leaders in different regards, and all had different methods of working. Some are very direct while others attempt to have you figure out the problem for yourself while guiding you down the right path. This type of different styles of leadership is exactly what I had wanted to experience here, and I’m happy to have had the opportunity to.</p>
                <p>Moreover, I was allowed, and even invited, to sit in on various meetings with our clients. This direct contact with our clients, to hear their exact  wording and descriptions, really gives you insight as a developer that can’t be achieved by a simple briefing. During these meetings, a lot of questions were asked by a representative of each skillset (development, design, UX etc.), and notes were taken. Afterwards, we as a team held one or more meetings as we went through the notes and broke them down into user stories and more elaborate descriptions to allow us to get to work as soon as possible. I find this to be a very efficient method of working, but only when the meetings are very well controlled and handled. If they get out of hand with off-topic discussions, or continuing to circle around a single topic for more than needed without reaching any conclusion is a huge drain on time and motivation. </p>
                <p>Finally, when it came to working, I was looking to see my teams’ chosen methods to work efficiently, write code efficiently, and the communication in a real multi-disciplinary team. I was happy to see how easy the flow inside each disciplinary team (developers or designers etc.) functioned. The designers had a fantastic feedback loop between each other to continuously improve their designs. Whereas the developers use Git in order to get everyone’s code in one place. In our Git flow, whenever any of us need to merge a chunk of code to the “Master” code (the code that will eventually get pushed to our production server, and therefore to our users) another (senior) developer has to perform what’s called a “Code Review”. A code review is simply a different programmer reading through another’s code and suggesting either improvements or asking for clarification where needed. Once the review is done, if there are any edits required those get worked out immediately, and then the code can seamlessly integrate into the existing Master code. These flows allow for rapid development on both sides, but don’t help much in terms of the bridge between them.</p>
                <p>Despite our very best efforts (in all of TRIMM) it is still very hard to find a balance where everyone is happy and no work goes to waste. The current standard is that the designers make something in either Photoshop or preferably Sketch, and when that’s done it’s send to the developers to develop. Because of this, minor changes take a lot more than they should to get implemented most of the time. Moreover, a lot of the time a designer needs to sit next to a developer to put the finishing touches on the design in order to make sure that everything is (near) pixel perfect. There are, however, new methods that our team is attempting to test in the upcoming few months to improve the bridge between designer and developer. One of these is to teach a designer CSS, and have them help write the CSS. This gives them more control over their work, and would also allow for quicker edits as the designer can do them themselves. This is still an on-going topic in the entire industry, which means it’s likely to drastically change at any moment when a new application comes on the market. </p>
                <p>All these different skills and insights coming together gives me a very thorough understanding of how an agency works, both in terms of motivating the employees, but also getting their work done.</p>
                <h3>FAQ</h3>
                <br/><strong>What could've gone better? </strong>
                <p>I could be more vocal (Dutch is a bit of a barrier, although to be fair I was told to speak English if Dutch became a problem)</p>
                <br/><strong>What didn't I like? </strong>
                <p>Not exactly didn’t like, but it was a rude awakening to find out that even a company as well established and prominent as TRIMM still has some of the problems that even smaller companies suffer from. I can’t go into too-deep of detail here of course, but I had simply (incorrectly) assumed that the process of work and getting work is a lot smoother.</p>
                <br/><strong>What does TRIMM do better? </strong>
                <p>TRIMM brings you, as an intern, into their workflow and treats you as an employee from day one. All of my colleagues were always very open to help me with any question I may have had, and offered advice where they believed I could improve. This wasn’t just for my work, but also for my personal  development at a professional level. The HR representatives in my team have taken the time, regularly, to have a short one-to-one meeting with me to see if there’s anything wrong, if there’s anything I would like to get off my chest, any worries etc. It was a breath of fresh air to experience this type of care from a corporate environment.</p>
                <br/><strong>What would you tell students considering TRIMM? </strong>
                <p>To absolutely go for it, if you care for your work. While TRIMM is a terrific place to work, and you have a lot of fun while working [ as I was typing this the team and I went into a discussion based off of Neil DeGrasse Tyson’s Cosmos on whether or not we are the first planet that have had life on it ] you also need to be able to dedicate yourself to a project and self-improving full-time as TRIMM does expect your best self.</p>
